a)\
context shape: (5, 50). (batchsize, context_size) \
next shape: (5,) (batchsize) \

b)
context contains the batched numerical data that act as the input ("previous knowledge") to predict the target values contained in next. \

c)
the key is split into 2 subkeys, one for the context and one for next, such that we dont reuse the same random variables when generating.
